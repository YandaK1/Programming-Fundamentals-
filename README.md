Programming Fundamentals are the essential concepts, principles, and techniques such as variables, data types, control structures (if/else), loops, and functions that form the core foundation of computer programming.

I have created four Fintech related TypeScript programs that cover data types namely; String, Number and Boolean.
The Fourth program covers all three of these data types in one example. 

1. transaction_fee_calculator.ts
2. bank_account_number_validator.ts
3. account_status_checker.ts
4. loan_qualification_validator.ts
